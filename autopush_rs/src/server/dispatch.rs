//! A future to figure out where we're going to dispatch a TCP socket.
//!
//! When the websocket server receives a TCP connection it may be a websocket
//! request or a general HTTP request. Right now the websocket library we're
//! using, Tungstenite, doesn't have built-in support for handling this
//! situation, so we roll our own.
//!
//! The general idea here is that we're going to read just enough data off the
//! socket to parse an initial HTTP request. This request will be parsed by the
//! `httparse` crate. Once we've got a request we take a look at the headers and
//! if we find a websocket upgrade we classify it as a websocket request. If
//! it's otherwise a `/status` request, we return that we're supposed to get the
//! status, and finally after all that if it doesn't match we return an error.
//!
//! This is basically a "poor man's" HTTP router and while it should be good
//! enough for now it should probably be extended/refactored in the future!
//!
//! Note that also to implement this we buffer the request that we read in
//! memory and then attach that to a socket once we've classified what kind of
//! socket this is. That's done to replay the bytes we read again for the
//! tungstenite library, which'll duplicate header parsing but we don't have
//! many other options for now!
