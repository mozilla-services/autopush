Release Process
===============

Autopush has a regular 2-3 week release to production depending on developer
and QA availability. The developer creating a release should handle all aspects
of the following process as they're done closely in order and time.

Versions
========

Autopush uses a ``{major}.{minor}.{patch}`` version scheme, new ``{major}``
versions are only issued if backwards compatibility is affected. Patch
versions are used if a critical bug occurs after production deployment that
requires a bugfix immediately.

Dev Releases
============

When changes are committed to the ``master`` branch, an operations Jenkins
instance will build and deploy the code automatically to the dev environment.

The development environment can be verified at its endpoint/wss endpoints:

* Websocket: wss://autopush.dev.mozaws.net/
* Endpoint: https://updates-autopush.dev.mozaws.net/

Stage/Production Releases
=========================

Pre-Requisites
--------------

To create a release, you will need appropriate access to the autopush
GitHub repository with push permission.

You will also need `clog <https://github.com/clog-tool/clog-cli>`_ installed
to create the ``CHANGELOG.md`` update.

Release Steps
-------------

In these steps, the ``{version}`` refers to the full version of the release.

i.e. If a new minor version is being released after ``1.21.0``, the
``{version}`` would be ``1.22.0``.

#. Switch to the ``master`` branch of autopush.
#. ``git pull`` to ensure the local copy is completely up-to-date.
#. ``git diff origin/master`` to ensure there are no local staged or uncommited
   changes.
#. Run ``tox`` locally to ensure no artifacts or other local changes that might
   break tests have been introduced.
#. Change to the release branch.

   If this is a new major/minor release,
   ``git checkout -b release/{major}.{minor}`` to create a new release branch.

   If this is a new patch release, you will first need to ensure you have the
   minor release branch checked out, then:

     #. ``git checkout release/{major}.{minor}``
     #. ``git pull`` to ensure the branch is up-to-date.
     #. ``git merge master`` to merge the new changes into the release branch.

   **Note that the release branch does not include a ``{patch}`` component**.
#. Edit ``autopush/__init__.py`` so that the version number reflects the
   desired release version.
#. Run ``clog --setversion {version}``, verify changes were properly
   accounted for in ``CHANGELOG.md``.
#. ``git add CHANGELOG.md autopush/__init__.py`` to add the two changes to the
   new release commit.
#. ``git commit -m "chore: tag {version}"`` to commit the new version and
   record of changes.
#. ``git tag {version}`` to tag the current HEAD commit for release.
#. ``git push --set-upstream origin release/{major}.{minor}`` to push the
   commits to a new origin release branch.
#. ``git push --tags origin release/{major}.{minor}`` to push the tags to the
   release branch.
#. Submit a pull request on github to merge the release branch to master.
#. Go to the `autopush releases page`_, you should see the new tag with no
   release information under it.
#. Click the ``Draft a new release`` button.
#. Enter the tag for ``Tag version``.
#. Copy/paste the changes from ``CHANGELOG.md`` into the release description
   omitting the top 2 lines (the a name HTML and the version) of the file.

   Keep these changes handy, you'll need them again shortly.
#. Once the release branch pull request is approved and merged, click ``Publish
   Release``.
#. File a bug for stage deployment in Bugzilla, in the ``Cloud Services``
   product, under the ``Operations: Deployment Requests`` component. It should
   be titled ``Please deploy autopush {major}.{minor} to STAGE`` and include
   the changes in the Description along with any additional instructions to
   operations regarding deployment changes and special test cases if needed
   for QA to verify.

At this point, QA will take-over, verify stage, and create a production
deployment Bugzilla ticket. QA will also schedule production deployment for the
release.
