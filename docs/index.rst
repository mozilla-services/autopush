Mozilla Push server and Push Endpoint utilizing PyPy, twisted, and DynamoDB.

This is the third generation of Push server built in Mozilla Services, first
to handle Push for FirefoxOS clients, then extended for push notifications for
Firefox (via the `W3C Push spec <http://w3c.github.io/push-api/index.html>`_.)

For how to read and respond to **autopush error codes**, see
:ref:`Errors <errors>`.

For an overview of the Mozilla Push Service and where autopush fits in, see
the `Mozilla Push Service architecture diagram`_. This push service uses
websockets to talk to Firefox, with a Push endpoint that implements the
:term:`WebPush` standard for its :ref:`http` API.
