Configuring the Amazon Device Messaging Bridge
==============================================

`ADM <https://developer.amazon.com/docs/adm/overview.html>`_ requires
credentials that are provided on the `Amazon Developer portal
<https://developer.amazon.com/myapps.html>`_ page. Note, this is different than
the *Amazon Web Services* page.

If you've not already done so, create a new App under the **Apps & Services**
tab. You will need to create an app so that you can associate a Security
Profile to it.

Device Messaging can be created by generating a new *Security Profile* (located
under the *Security Profiles* sub-tab. If specifying for Android or Kindle,
you will need to provide the Java Package name you've used to identify the
application (e.g. `org.mozilla.services.admpushdemo`)

You will need to provide the MD5 Signature and SHA256 Signature for the
package's Certificate.

Getting the Key Signatures
--------------------------

Amazon provides `some instructions <https://developer.amazon
.com/docs/login-with-amazon/register-android.html#app-signatures-and-keys>`_
for getting the signature values of the `CERT.RSA` file. Be aware that android
and ADM are both moving targets and some information may no longer be correct.

I was able to use the `keytool` to fetch out the SHA256 signature, but had to
get the MD5 signature from inside **Android Studio** by looking under the
*Gradle* tab, then under the Project (root)

.. code-block:: text

   > Task
     > android
      * signingReport

You do not need the SHA1: key provided from the signingReport output.

Once the fields have been provided an API Key will be generated. This is a
long JWT that must be stored in a file named `api_key.txt` located in the
`/assets` directory. The file should only contain the key. Extra white
space, comments, or other data will cause the key to fail to be read.

This file *MUST* be included with any client application that uses the ADM
bridge. Please note that the only way to test ADM messaging features is to
side load the application on a FireTV or Kindle device.

Configuring the server
----------------------

The server requires the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* from  the ADM Security
Profile page. Since a given server may need to talk to different
applications using different profiles, the server can be configured to use
one of several profiles.

The `autopush_endpoint.ini` file may contain the `adm_creds` option. This is
a JSON structure similar to the APNS configuration. The configuration can
specify one or more "profiles". Each profile contains a "client_id" and
"client_secret".

For example, let's say that we want to have a "dev" (for developers) and a
"stage" (for testing). We could specify the profiles as:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "dev": {
        "client_id": "amzn1.application.0e7299...",
        "client_secret": "559dac53757a571d2fee78e5fcb2..."
      },
     "stage": {
        "client_id": "amzn1.application.0e7300...",
        "client_secret": "589dcc53957a971d2fee78e5fee4..."
      },
   }

For the configuration, we'd collapse this to one line, e.g.

.. code-block:: text

   adm_creds={"dev":{"client_id":"amzn1.application.0e7299...","client_secret":"559dac53757a571d2fee78e5fcb2..."},"stage":{"client_id":"amzn1.application.0e7300...","client_secret": "589dcc53957a971d2fee78e5fee4..."},}

Much like other systems, a sender invokes the profile by using it in the
Registration URL. e.g. to register a new endpoint using the `dev` profile:

  `https://push.service.mozilla.org/v1/adm/dev/registration/`
