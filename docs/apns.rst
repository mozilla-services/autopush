Configuring for the APNS bridge
===============================

APNS requires a current Apple Developer License for the platform
or platforms you wish to bridge to (e.g. iOS, desktop, etc.). Once
that license has been acquired, you will need to create and export
a valid `.p12` type key file. For this document, we will concentrate
on creating an iOS certificate.

Create the App ID
-----------------

First, you will need an Application ID. If you do not already have an
application, you will need to `create an application ID <https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifier/bundle/create>`_.
For an App ID to use Push Notifications, it must be created as an **Explicit App ID**.
Please be sure that under "**App Services**" you select **Push Notifications**.
Once these values are set, click on [Continue].

Confirm that the app settings are as you desire and click [Register], or click [Back] and correct them.
**Push Notifications** should appear as "Configurable".

Create the Certificate
----------------------

Then `Create a new certificate <https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/certificate/create>`_.
Select "Apple Push Notification service SSL" for either Development or Production, depending on
intended usage of the certificate. "Development", in this case, means a certificate that will
not be used by an application released for general public use, but instead only for personal
or team development. This is also known as a "Sandbox" application and will require
setting the "use_sandbox" flag. Once the preferred option is selected, click
[Continue].

Select the App ID that matches the Application that will use Push Notifications. Several
Application IDs may be present, be sure to match the correct App ID. This will be the App ID which
will act as the recipient bridge for Push Notifications. Select [Continue].

Follow the on-screen instructions to generate a **CSR file**, click [Continue],
and upload the CSR.

Download the newly created *iOSTeam_Provisioning_Profile_.mobileprovision* keyset, and
import it into your **KeyChain Access** app.

Exporting the .p12 key set
--------------------------

In **KeyChain Access**, for the **login** keychain, in the **Certificates** category,
you should find an **Apple Push Services: *your AppID*** certificate. Right click on
this certificate and select *Export "Apple Push Services:"...*. Provide the file
with a reasonably unique name, such as "Push_Production_APNS_Keys.p12", so that you can find it easily
later. You may wish to secure these keys with a password.

Converting .p12 to PEM
----------------------

You will need to convert the .p12 file to PEM format. *openssl* can perform
these steps for you. A simple script you could use might be:

.. code-block:: bash

   #!/bin/bash
   echo Converting $1 to PEM
   openssl pkcs12 -in $1 -out $1_cert.pem -clcerts -nokeys
   openssl pkcs12 -in $1 -out $1_key.pem -nocerts -nodes


This will divide the p12 key into two components that can be read by the autopush application.

Sending the APNS message
------------------------

The APNS post message contains JSON formatted data similar to the following:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "aps": {
            "content-available": 1
        },
        "key": "value",
        ...
    }


*aps* is reserved as a sub-dictionary. All other *key*: *value* slots are open.

In addition, you must specify the following headers:

* *apns-id*: A lowercase, dash formatted UUID for this message.

* *apns-priority*: Either **10** for Immediate delivery or **5** for delayable delivery.

* *apns-topic*: The bundle ID for the recipient application. This must match the bundle ID of the AppID used to create the *"Apple Push Services:..."* certificate. It usually has the format of `com.example.ApplicationName`.

* *apns-expiration*: The timestamp for when this message should expire in UTC based seconds.  A zero ("0") means immediate expiration.

Handling APNS responses
-----------------------

APNS returns a status code and an optional JSON block describing the error. A list of `these
responses are provided in the APNS documentation <https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/CommunicatingwithAPNs.html>`_ (Note, Apple may change the document locaiton without warning. you may be able to search using `DeviceTokenNotForTopic <https://developer.apple.com/search/?q=DeviceTokenNotForTopic&type=Guides>`_ or similar error messages.)
